Generate Random Number:*
 Leveraging JavaScript's Math.random() function, I successfully generated a random number to keep the game unpredictable and fun.

2. *Access User Entered Value:*
 Using input elements and JavaScript, I seamlessly captured the user's guessed number, creating an engaging interactive experience.

3. *Compare with the Random Number and Display the Result:*
 I implemented logic to compare the user's guess with the generated random number. The game dynamically displays whether the guess was too high, too low, or spot-on!

4. *Handle Invalid User Input:*
 Recognizing the importance of a smooth user experience, I added error-handling mechanisms to gracefully manage invalid inputs. This ensures that the game maintains its integrity throughout
